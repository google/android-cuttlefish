    <!-- Whether to only install system packages on a user if they're whitelisted for that user
         type. These are flags and can be freely combined.
         0  - disable whitelist (install all system packages; no logging)
         1  - enforce (only install system packages if they are whitelisted)
         2  - log (log non-whitelisted packages)
         4  - any package not mentioned in the whitelist file is implicitly whitelisted on all users
         8  - same as 4, but just for the SYSTEM user
         16 - ignore OTAs (don't install system packages during OTAs)
         Common scenarios:
          - to enable feature (fully enforced) for a complete whitelist: 1
          - to enable feature for an incomplete whitelist (so use implicit whitelist mode): 5
          - to enable feature but implicitly whitelist for SYSTEM user to ease local development: 9
          - to disable feature completely if it had never been enabled: 16
          - to henceforth disable feature and try to undo its previous effects: 0
        Note: This list must be kept current with PACKAGE_WHITELIST_MODE_PROP in
