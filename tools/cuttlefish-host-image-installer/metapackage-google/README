The Debian Package metapackage-google
----------------------------

This is the metapackage for Google Android Cuttlefish project.
In this project, Google works with Linaro to build an ARM64 Debian stable host image on Gigabyte Ampere.

Please note that this package is usually not installed manually.
It should be installed by Debian installer through preseed.

For example, it changes the ntp.conf but not restarting the ntp server.
Because we assume that it runs by preseed and will have a force reboot
after the installation completed.

## Add more packages to be installed.

Modify debian/control. Add packages in Depends field.
After modification, run wrap-and-sort to keep the list sorted.

## Install files.

Put the file into this metapackage. And modify
debian/metapackage-google.install to install it to the its place.

## Add more customization script.
